          I was a Vindicator sice I graduated. Instead of doing what I studied for I decided to travel the universe
          looking for adventures. And boy, oh boy did I find them! I worked at Blitz-and-Chitz, where I met my friend
          Rick. He introduced me to the Vindicators and as soon as I met them I knew I wanted to be one. But then they
          died in an accident, or a fight or something and now I'm jobless and I wanna go on adventures but with people
          that won't die so easy so hit me up to go on adventures and take down aliens and galactic mafia bosses and
          whatnot.</p>

            problem. It was pretty easy. All we had to do was show them how their socioeconomic model was bound to
            collapse under its own weight and they were happy to solve it. And we celebrated with mushrooms but it's
            fine because our bodies processde it differently.

          galaxy looking for the perfect pooping place, since he's a shy pooper. He stopped time with a time dilation
          fish that he keeps in his 6-dimensional fish bowl. We ended two civil wars and one mass extinction before I
          found the planet where Rick goes to shit.</p>

          conquer the universe by making TikTok an interstellar social network. What kind of messed up creature would
          do that? To doom the universe to a dull, pointless existence of approval seeking. Goddamn! That's a whole new
          level of evil.</p>

          <p class="job-caption">I was a member of the Vindicators for five years in which we got into the craziest
          situations. Like that time the fork headed dolphins took over the Inter-Dimensional Cable TV Agency and we
          joined forces with the reverse Justice Avengers of the Galaxy and freed freedom of speach. Or that other time
          when we were trapped in the cube sphere and when we broke free turned out that was the explosion that created
          tha Big Bang or something like that. Anyway the main thing to get from here is I know how to kill, which is
          90% of the superhero's job. Unlike that spineless ass-face Batman who keeps letting villains live and kill
          more people but is more than happy to kill his friend Superman. The hell is that about?!<br>
          Also I'm not sure why but the Vindicators are dead now and I'm the only one left which I guess it means I'm
          the strongest. Maybe I'll start having adventures on my own but if you want me to joing your superhero crew
          give me a call. I'll be waiting. There's not much to do lately so yeah. Let me know.</p>

            like Russian roulette but with a ray guy that's fully loaded so a shitty experience altogether. Why do

          and he cloned himself and sent the clone to Earth to live with his family while he spends the rest of his life
          here. It's the best planet in the universe. And has the best food.</p>
